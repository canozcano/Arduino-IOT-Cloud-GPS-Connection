# Arduino-IOT-Cloud-GPS-Connection

Description
This project utilizes the Arduino IoT Cloud platform for IoT applications. It allows you to remotely monitor and control your Arduino devices over the internet.

Please Note: This project is currently in development and may encounter issues during usage. It is recommended for testing and experimentation purposes only.

Installation
To set up this project with Arduino IoT Cloud, follow these steps:

Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Open the Arduino IDE and navigate to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries.
Install the required libraries for the project, including ArduinoIoTCloud and any additional sensor libraries used in your project.
Configure the project settings in the arduino_secrets.h file. This file contains your Wi-Fi credentials and IoT Cloud settings. Make sure to update them with your own information.
Upload the sketch (*.ino file) to your Arduino board.
Open the Arduino IoT Cloud dashboard (https://create.arduino.cc/iot/dashboard) and create a new Thing for your project.
Add properties to your Thing, such as sensors, actuators, etc., as needed.
Connect your Arduino board to the Arduino IoT Cloud by following the instructions provided in the dashboard.
Test your project by interacting with it through the Arduino IoT Cloud dashboard.
Usage
Once the project is set up and connected to Arduino IoT Cloud, you can monitor and control your devices remotely using the dashboard. You can view sensor data, trigger actions, and receive notifications based on predefined conditions.
